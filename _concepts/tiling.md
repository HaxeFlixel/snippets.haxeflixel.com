Tiling is a great way to build levels and maps, backgrounds, and scenery in your game. They are especially great for retro-style games, but can be utilized in other games, as well.

There are two main objects in HaxeFlixel that utilize tiling: {% api flixel.tile.FlxTileblock %} and {% api flixel.tile.FlxTilemap %}.
