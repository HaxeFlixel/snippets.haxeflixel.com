This is the source code for the HaxeFlixel Snippets website. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The goal of this site is to become a complete resource for anyone wanting to start learning [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) (a free, open-source, cross-platform game development library), and a quick-reference for anyone who wants to know how to do something specific.

More details can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/snippets.haxeflixel.com/wiki)
